          in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling
          material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual
          force. The class which has the means of material production at its
          disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental
          production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those
          who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling
          ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant
          material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as
          ideas. <span class="karl_qoration">"</span
